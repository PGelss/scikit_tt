    "Now, let's look at a well-known example for supervised learning problem which involves the classification of handwritten digits. One of the frequently used datasets in this context is the so-called MNIST dataset. It actually contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images with their corresponding classes (i.e., 0,...,9). To reduce computation time, we will examine a reduced dataset extracted from the MNIST dataset. This consists of images with 7x7 pixels, representing only the digits 0 and 1. We have 500 training images and 100 test images at our disposal.\n",

    "To conclude, let's take a look at a modified version of an established model for the CO oxidation at RuO2(110), which is a popular fruit-fly system in the theoretical study of heterogeneous catalysis (i.e., a type of catalysis in which the phase of the catalyst differs from that of the reactants). In multiscale models of heterogeneous catalysis, one crucial point is the solution of a Markovian master equation describing the stochastic reaction kinetics. This usually is too high-dimensional to be solved with standard numerical techniques\n",
