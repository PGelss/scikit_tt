    """TT approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator in 2D

    Given transitions of particles in a 2-dimensional potential, compute the approximation of the corresponding Perron-

    Parameters
    ----------
    transitions: ndarray
        matrix containing the transitions, each row is of the form [x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2] representing a transition from
        state (x_1, x_2) to (y_1, y_2)
    states: list of ints
        number of states in x- and y-direction
    simulations: int
        number of simulations per state

    Returns
    -------
    operator: instance of TT class
        TT approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator
